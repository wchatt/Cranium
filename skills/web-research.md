# Web Research — Search, Evaluate, Present

## When to Use
The user asks you to research a topic, compare options, find information, or answer a question that requires current web data.

## Search Patterns
1. **Start broad, then narrow.** First search gives you the landscape; follow-up searches target specifics.
2. **Use multiple queries.** Rephrase the question 2-3 ways to catch different angles. One query rarely covers everything.
3. **Check primary sources.** Blog posts and forums give leads; official docs and papers give facts. Always prefer primary sources.
4. **Date-filter when freshness matters.** Add the current year to queries for fast-moving topics (frameworks, pricing, APIs).

## Source Evaluation
- **Official documentation** > blog posts > forum answers > AI-generated summaries
- **Cross-reference claims.** If only one source says it, flag it as unverified.
- **Check dates.** A 2-year-old Stack Overflow answer about a fast-moving framework may be wrong today.
- **Quantify confidence.** "Multiple official sources confirm X" vs. "One blog post from 2023 claims X."

## Presenting Findings
- **Lead with the answer.** Don't make the user read through your research process.
- **Cite sources.** Include URLs so the user can verify.
- **Flag uncertainty.** If sources conflict or data is sparse, say so explicitly.
- **Recommend, don't just list.** If the user asked "which should I use?", pick one and say why.
- **Keep it concise.** A 5-bullet summary with links beats a 3-page essay. The user can ask for more depth.
